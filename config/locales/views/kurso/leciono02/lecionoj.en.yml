          pagxo01: 
            frazoj: 
              frazo-amikino: "The beautiful (female) friend"
              frazo-patrino: "The good mother"
              frazo-virino: "The big women"
            sufikso-ino: "Suffix -ino"
            sufikso-ino-ekspliko-1: "In the first lesson we saw that in Esperanto adjectives agree in number (singular or plural) with the nouns they describe; when a noun refers to one thing, its adjectives stay singular and when the noun refers to more than one, its adjectives are made plural."
            sufikso-ino-ekspliko-2: "Most nouns do not indicate gender, but a small number referring to people do.  For such words, the '-o' ending refers to males and '-ino' refers to females."
            vortoj: 
              amikino: "(female) friend"
              amiko: friend

          pagxo02: 
            akusativo: "Accusative (-n)"
            akusativo-ekzpliko-1: "Another very useful ending allows us to identify the direct object of a sentence. It is the accusative ending \"n\", placed at the end of nouns, adjectives, and pronouns.  (Note:  The direct object is what the verb acts upon.  It receives the action of the verb.  E.g., in \"I see you\", \"you\" is the direct object)."
            akusativo-ekzpliko-2: "Note that the accusative \"n\" is always at the end of the word (after the plural \"j\"). The direct object may go anywhere in the sentence without changing its meaning. The following three sentences have the same meaning:"
            akusativo-rimarkigo-1: "The different word order may be used for emphasis. We will see this in a later lesson."
            akusativo-rimarkigo-2: "The accusative is not used after the verb \"esti\".  \"Esti\" is a so-called linking verb which implies that the subject and the object are equivalent."
            frazo-plurala: "I wash the new cups."
            frazo-singulara: "I wash the new cup."
          pagxo03:

              neado: Negation
              neado-ekspliko: "To make a negative sentence it is enough to put the word \"ne\" (no, not) before the verb."
