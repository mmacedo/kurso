      imperativo: 
        ekspliko-1: "The imperative mode (-u) generally relates to the second person, and in that case it is not necessary to use the pronoun 'you'. However, when referring to the first or third person, we need to use the pronoun."

After verbs expressing hope (esperi), fear (timi), disbelief (ne kredi), supposition (supozi), don't use -U mode."

        ekspliko-1: "A participle is a special form of a verb used with some form of 'esti' to form compound tenses."

We can regard the combination 'esti' + participle as a compound verb, or we can consider the participle to be a predicate adjective which modifies the subject.  A participle ending in '-a' can also precede a noun and function as an ordinary adjective.  Participles ending in '-e' function as adverbs.  Participles ending in '-o' function as nouns.  Examples follow."
        ekspliko-3: "The participles can be combined with other tenses of 'esti'.  Let's imagine that we are looking at people in a doctor's office.  There is one person waiting, another ready to leave, and another is with the doctor.  For each person and the doctor we may say that now:"
