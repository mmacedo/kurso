      verba_transitiveco: 
        ekspliko: "Some verbs, called transitive verbs, take a direct object.  In lesson 2 we saw that a direct object is always in the accusative case.  Other verbs, called intransitive verbs, do not take a direct object.  For example,"

          ekspliko: "All verbs with the suffix '-iĝi' are intransitive (no direct object).  They are often formed by adding '-iĝi' to a noun or to an adjective.  The meaning can generally be expressed by the English verb 'to become'."
          unu: 
            ekspliko: "Verbs ending in '-iĝi' typically indicate a transition to a new state whose characteristics are indicated by the root.  The doer or perpetrator of the action is not specified."

        rimarkigo-2: 
          ekspliko: "Always remember that the verb  \"esti\"  doesn't require the accusative.  Don't use the accusative after a preposition."
        sen-subjekto:

      vortfarado: 
        ekspliko-1: "Certainly you already noted the extraordinary possibility of expression of Esperanto.  In fact, by adding various prefixes, suffixes and grammatical endings to a given root, you can create many words, some of them without a direct translation to English.  Some examples of word creation follow:"

        ekspliko-3: "Joining roots.  The grammatical ending of the first element, often '-o', is usually omitted, but it may be retained to facilitate pronounceability."
        ekspliko-4: "Creating words from groups of words:"
        rimarkigo: "Even if it is possible to build words with more than two prefixes and/or suffixes, in favor of clarity and elegance it is preferable to avoid such creations.  Thus, instead of \"belulineto\"  we prefer  \"eta belulino\".  The order in which affixes occur influences meaning:"
